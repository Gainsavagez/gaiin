t the number of movies college students see in a month. The program
should perform the following steps:
A) Ask the user how many students were surveyed. An array of intege
rs with this many elements should then be dynamically allocated.
B) Allow the user to enter the number of movies each student saw into the array.
C) Calculate and display the average, median, and mode of the values
 entered. (Use the functions you wrote in Programming Challenges 8
 and 9 to calculate the median and mode.)
Input Validation: Do not accept negative numbers for input.
